# Getting Started

The utilities that are provided in the `@flare-city/core` package are designed with familiar APIs to easily get you started with creating a routing structure to handle calls to specific endpoints. Since this is designed specifically for Cloudflare Workers, this guide will be CF Workers convention heavy.

<Steps>
### Create a new App instance
The `App` class will help you setup how your routes will be parsed, ingested, validated and then subsuquently run.

```ts
// index.ts
import { App, Env } from "@flare-city/core";

const myApp = new App("myAppName");
```

For more information on the `App` class, [check out the `App` documentation](./reference/core/app.md)

### Add any middleware

Add any middlware that you feel you need. Since CF Workers are just short lived functions on the edge, the best practice is to put utilities, common use functions
and other non-serializeable things on the execution context.

In the example below, we're calling a `middlewarePrisma` that we have defined locally to add a prisma/client
to the execution context so we can easily access the prisma client in each handler to run type-safe DB queries.

```ts
import { middlewarePrisma } from "./lib";

myApp.addMiddleware(middlewarePrisma);
```

For more information on the `Middleware` type, [check out the `Middleware` documentation](./reference/core/middleware.md)

### Define & add any routes

Routes define the API endpoints and their corresponding handlers.

For more information on the `Route` class, [check out the `Route` documentation](./reference/core/route.md)

```ts
import { RouteTest, RouteTeam } from "./features";

myApp.addRoute(RouteTest);
myApp.addRoute(RouteTeam);
```

### Start the application

The `start` method exports a static object with a `fetch` property on it that is cast to
the `myApp.run` method. You can either export the `myApp.start()` method or manually default export
the fetch key yourself and run the `myApp.run` method

```ts
export default API.start();

// -- OR --

export default {
  fetch: async function (
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ) {
    return myApp.run(request, env, context);
  },
};
```

</Steps>

Below, for reference, is an example of what the `src/index.ts` file should look like when creating your Cloudflare API.

```ts
// src/index.ts - CloudFlare fetch entrypoint

import { log, middlewarePrisma } from "./lib";
import { App, Env } from "@flare-city/core";
import { RouteTest, RouteTeam } from "./features";

// Declare a new application
export const API = new App("shank-city");

// Add Middleware
API.addMiddleware(middlewarePrisma);

// Add routes
API.addRoute(RouteTest);
API.addRoute(RouteTeam);

// Start the API
export default API.start();
```
