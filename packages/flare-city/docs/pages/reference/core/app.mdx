# `@flare-city/core` - App

## Overview

The `App` class is a central component of the `@flare-city/core` package, designed to streamline the development of APIs on Cloudflare Workers. It serves as an orchestrator for managing routes, middleware functions, and request handling.
The `App` class simplifies the organization and handling of routes and middleware in Cloudflare Worker-based APIs. By following the provided examples and guidelines, developers can create robust and structured serverless applications.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Application Initialization

- **Constructor:** The `App` class is instantiated by providing a name for the application.

### 2. Route and Middleware Management

- **Routes:** The `addRoute` method is used to add routes to the application, allowing for organized route handling.
- **Middleware:** Middleware functions, defined as asynchronous functions, can be added using the `addMiddleware` method. These functions are executed before the route handler.

### 3. Request Handling

- **Middleware Execution:** The `runMiddlewares` private method iterates through added middleware functions, executing them in sequence.
- **Route Matching:** The `run` method matches the incoming request's pathname to registered routes based on their base paths.
- **Error Handling:** If no matching route is found, an `ErrorNotFound` error is thrown, providing a meaningful error message.

## How to Use

<Steps>

### Creating an App Instance

```typescript
import { App } from "@flare-city/core";

const myApp = new App("MyApp");
```

### Adding Routes and Middleware

```typescript
import { Route, Middleware } from "@flare-city/core";

const myRoute = new Route({ basePath: "/api" });

myApp.addRoute(myRoute);

const myMiddleware: Middleware = async (request, env, context) => {
  // Your middleware logic here
};

myApp.addMiddleware(myMiddleware);
```

### Running the App

```typescript
// src/index.ts
export default myApp.start();
```

</Steps>

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic App Setup

```typescript
// src/index.ts

const myApp = new App("MyApp");

const homeRoute = new Route({ basePath: "/home" });

myApp.addRoute(homeRoute);

export default myApp.start();
```

### Example 2: App with Middleware

```typescript
// src/index.ts

const myApp = new App("MyApp");

const authMiddleware: Middleware = async (request, env, context) => {
  // Your authentication logic here
};

myApp.addMiddleware(authMiddleware);

const securedRoute = new Route({
  basePath: "/secured",
  middleware: [authMiddleware],
});

myApp.addRoute(securedRoute);

export default myApp.start();
```
