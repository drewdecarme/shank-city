# Guides

The below sections will walk you through common scenarios in which you would use the `flare-city` framework to accomplish common tasks such as:

- Adding authentication
- Adding middleware
- Adding a DB to query

## Authenticate your API

In this section, you'll learn how to implement secure authentication for your API using Auth0. Auth0 is a powerful authentication and authorization platform that simplifies the process of integrating secure login functionality into your application. You'll explore the steps to set up Auth0, configure your API to use it, and ensure that only authorized users can access your API's resources.

## Add middleware to enrich the execution context

Middleware is like the secret sauce that enhances the capabilities of your API. In this section, you'll delve into the world of middleware to understand how it can enrich the context of your application. Whether it's logging, error handling, or adding custom data to each request, middleware plays a crucial role. Learn how to seamlessly integrate middleware into your API to make it more robust, flexible, and tailored to your specific needs.

## Add a database to run queries against

Dive into the realm of databases in this section, where you'll discover how to integrate a database into your API to store and retrieve data efficiently. Whether it's a relational database like MySQL, a NoSQL database like MongoDB, or something else entirely, you'll explore the steps to set up and configure the database. Learn how to run queries against it, handle data storage, and ensure that your API interacts seamlessly with the underlying data store.
